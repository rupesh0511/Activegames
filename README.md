Head Section (`<head>):

Meta Tags: I use meta tags to provide essential information about the document, such as the character set and viewport settings, which help with proper rendering on various devices.

Link Tags: I include link tags to import external stylesheets from Google Fonts and a custom CSS file (styles.css) for styling the webpage.
Body Section (`<body>):
